## Graph Analytic Tools
### [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/)
ClickHouse is a fast open-source OLAP database management system.
It is column-oriented and allows to generate analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time.
This tool has become the standard for the analysis of blockchain data, it combines high speed and flexibility.
### [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
#### [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes)
GraphFrames is a package for Apache Spark which provides DataFrame-based Graphs. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, and Python. It aims to provide both the functionality of GraphX and extended functionality taking advantage of Spark DataFrames. This extended functionality includes motif finding, DataFrame-based serialization, and highly expressive graph queries.
#### [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html)
GraphX is a new component in Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation. At a high level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD by introducing a new Graph abstraction: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge.
### [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
The well-known graph database has wide functionality for graph analysis. The free version has significant limitations and can be recommended for analyzing graphs with a total number of edges and vertices of less than 10M. I do not recommend using it in a production.
## Data Science Analytic Tools
### [Machine Learning Financial Laboratory (mlfinlab)](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/)
MlFinlab is a python package which helps portfolio managers and traders who want to leverage the power of machine learning by providing reproducible, interpretable, and easy to use tools. 
### [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/)
